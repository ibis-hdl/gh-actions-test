# Linux/Ubuntu C++ Dev Container for Project

See:
- [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)
- [GitHub vscode-dev-containers for C++](
   https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/cpp)

This folder includes configuration files for building dev containers for use with Visual Studio
Code. Nevertheless it is working without VS Code, to be used by cmake CLI.
